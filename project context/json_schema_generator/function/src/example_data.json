        "case" : "ASSOCIATION WITH GOOD companions is a serious recommendation of the ancient sages. Students today should follow the words of the Buddhas and Patriarchs by finding a teacher to attain discernment. Otherwise, how can you call yourselves students?\nIf you want to clarify this matter, you must arouse wonder and look into it. If you wonder deeply about this matter, transcendental knowledge will become manifest. Why? The task of the journey just requires the sense of doubt to cease. If you do. not actively wonder, how can the sense of doubt cease?\nMy teacher was thirty-five years old before he became a monk. He stayed in the city of Chengdu to listen to lectures on The Hundred Phenomena as 'Only Representation. There he heard a saying of how when a Buddhist enters the path of insight, knowledge and principle merge, environment and mind join, and there is no distinction between that which realizes and that which is realized. A Hindu challenged the Buddhists, \"If there is no distinction between what realizes and what is realized, what is used as proof?\" No one could answer this challenge, so the Buddhists were declared the losers in debate. Later the Buddhist canonical master of Tang came to the rescue of the doctrine:\n\"When knowledge and principle merge, environment and mind unite, it is like when drinking water one spontaneously knows whether it is cool or warm.\"\nWhat about the travels of my late teacher calling on teachers \u2014 why did he later say he questioned an aged grandfather? What about selling and buying oneself \u2014 what is that? You should realize there is no excess; what the man of old said is all you.\nHe also said, \"I have never had a single statement to reach you. If I had a statement to reach you, what use would it be?\" Do you want your feeling of doubt broken? You too must be like my late teacher once before you can accomplish it.\nNow my teacher thought, \"It may be cool or warm, all right; but what is this business of spontaneous knowing?\" He wondered and questioned very deeply. He asked the lecturer about the principle of spontaneous knowing, but the lecturer couldn't answer; instead, he said, \"If you want to clarify this principle, I cannot explain it, but in the South there are adep'ts who have found out the source of the enlightened mind; they know about this matter. You will have to journey for it.\"\nSo my teacher went traveling. He went to the capital city, and all around the eastern riverlands, asking every Zen adept he could find about this matter. And everyone he asked gave him a reply. Some explained, some spoke in aphorisms. In any case, his feeling of doubt remained unbroken.\nLater he came to Fushan. Seeing that everything Fushan said in lectures and interviews was relevant to what was in his mind, he wound up staying for a year. Fushan had him contemplate the phrase, \"Buddha had a secret saying, Kasyapa didn't conceal it.\"\nOne day Fushan said to him, \"Why didn't you come earlier? You should go call on Baiyun Duan.\" So my teacher went to Baiyun. One day when he went into the teaching auditorium, all of a sudden he realized great enlightenment. \"'Buddha has a secret saying, Kasyapa didn't conceal it' \u2014 of course! Of course! When knowledge and principle merge, environment andmind unite, it is like when one drinks water one spontaneously knows whether it's warm or cool. How true these words are!\" Then he composed a verse on his attainment:\nAt an idle patch of field before the mountain\nPolitely I question an aged grandfather!\nHow many times have I sold and bought myself?\nCharmingly, the pine and bamboo draw a clear breeze.\nWhen Baiyun read this, he nodded. Is this no: a case of doubting and wondering profoundly, approaching people who know, and only then succeeding in clarification?\n",

You see everything with the same eye that they saw with, hear everything with the same ear. Is not this a blessed condition? Wouldn't you like to pass this barrier?

You kill him! A master of Zen? You kill him!\nThough you stand on the brink of life and death, you have the Great Freedom. In the four modes of the six rebirths you are in a state of peace and truth.
